    <p>
      Roll one die. Add 6 to the number rolled and enter the total in the SKILL
      box on the Adventure Sheet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roll two dice. Add 12 to the number rolled and enter the total in the
      STAMINA box.
    </p>
    <p>Roll one die. Add 6 and enter the total in the LUCK box.</p>
    <p>
      All your scores will change during your your adventure - for reasons that
      will be explained below. You must keep an accurate record ofthese scores,
      and for this reason you areadvised to write small in the boxes or to keep
      an eraser handy- But never rub out your Initial scores. As in other
      Fighting Fantasy Game books, although you may be awarded additional SKILL,
      STAMINA and LUCK points, the totals of these may never exceed your initial
      scores, except on those very mre occasions when the text specifically
      tells you so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your SKILL score reflects your expertise in combat and other challenging
      situations. Your STAMINA score reflects how healthy or physically fit you
      are. Your LUCK score indicates how lucky you are. ln all these cases, the
      higher the score, the better.
    </p>

    <h3 class="tw-mt-3"><a id="battles">Battles</a></h3>
    <p>
      During your adventure you will often encounter hostile cieatures which
      will attack you, and you yourself may choose to draw your sword against an
      enemy you chance across, ln some such situations you may be given special
      options allowing you to deal with the encounter in an unusual manner, but
      in most cases you will have to resolve battles as described below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enter your opponent's SKILL and STAMINA scores in the first vacant
      Encounter Box on your Adventure Sheet. You should also make a note of any
      special abilities or instructions which are unique to that particular
      opponent. Then follow this sequence:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Roll both dice for your opponent. Add its SKILL score to the total
        rolled, to find its Attack Strength
      </li>
      <li>
        Roll both dice for yourself then add your current SKILL score to find
        your Attack Strength.
      </li>
      <li>
        If your Attack Strength is higher than opponent's, you have wounded it:
        proceed to step 4. If your opponent's Attack Strength is higher than
        yours, it has wounded you: proceed to step 5. If both Attack Strength
        totals are the same, you have avoided or parried each other's blows:
        start a new Attack Round from step 1 above.
      </li>
      <li>
        You have wounded your opponent, so subtract 2 points from its STAMINA
        score. You may use LUCK here to do additional damage (see below).
      </li>
      <li>
        Your opponent has wounded you, so subtract 2 points from your own
        STAMINA. You may use LUCK to reduce the loss of STAMINA (see below).
      </li>
      <li>
        Begin the next Attack Round, starting again at step 1. This seouence
        continues until the STAMINA score of either you or your opponent reaches
        zero, which means death. If your opponent dies, you are free to continue
        with your adventure. If you die, your adventure ends and you must start
        all over again by creating a new character.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h4 class="tw-mb-2">
      <a id="fighting-more-than-one-opponent">
        Fighting more than one Opponent
      </a>
    </h4>
    <p>
      In some situations you may find yourself facing more than one enemy.
      Sometimes you will heat them as a single opponent; sometimes you will
      fight each in turn; and sometimes you will have to fight them all at the
      same time! If they are treated as a single opponent, the combat is
      resolved normally.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you are instructed to fight your opponents one at a time, the combat
      is again resolved normally except that, once you defeat creafure, the next
      steps in to fight you! When you find yourcelf under attack from more than
      one opponent at the same time, each adversary will make a sepamte attack
      on you in each Attack Round, but you choose which one to fight. Attack
      your chosen target as in a normal battle. Against additional opponents you
      throw for your Attack Strength in the normal way, if your Attack Strength
      is greater, you will not inflict a wound/ however. Just regard this as if
      you have parried an incoming blow. However, if your Attack Strength is
      lower, you will have been wounded in the normal way.
    </p>

    <h3 class="tw-mt-3"><a id="luck">Luck</a></h3>
    <p>
      At various times during your advenfure, either in battles or when you come
      across other situations in which you could either be Lucky or Unlucky
      (details of these are given on the pages themselves), you may use LUCK to
      make the outcome more favourable. But beware! Using LUCK is risky business
      and, if you are Unlucky, the results could be disastrous.
    </p>
    <p>
      The procedure, called "Testing your Luck", is as folIows: Roll two dice.
      If the number rolled is equal to or less than your curent LUCK score, you
      been Lucky and the result will go in your favour. If the number rolled is
      is higher than your current LUCK score, you have been Unlucky and you will
      penalized. Each time you Test your Luck, you must subtract 1 point from
      your current LUCK score. Thus you will soon realize that the more you rely
      on your LUCK, the more risky this will become.
    </p>
    <h4 class="tw-mb-2">
      <a id="luck-in-battles">Using Luck in Battles</a>
    </h4>
    <p>
      On certain pages of the book you will be told to Test your Luck, and you
      will then find out the consequences of being Lucky or Unlucky. However, in
      bdttles, you always have the option of using your LUCK, either to inflict
      a more serious wound on an opponent you have just wounded or to minimize
      the effects of a wound you have just received.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have just wounded an opponent, you may Test your Luck as descibed
      above. If you are Luck, you have inflicted a severe wound; deduct an extra
      2 points from your opponent's STAMINA score. If you are Unlucky, however,
      your blow only scratches your opponent, and you deduct 1 point less from
      your opponent's STAMINA (i.e. instead of scoring the normal 2 points of
      damage, you have now scored only 1).
    </p>
    <p>
      Whenever you are wounded in combat, you may Test your Luck to try and
      minimize the wound. If you are Lucky, your opponents blow only grazes you;
      you should deduct 1 point less from your STAMINA than normal. If you are
      Unlucky, your wound is a serious one and you must deduct 1 extra point
      from your STAMTNA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember that you must subtract 1 point ftom your LUCK score each time you
      test your Luck
