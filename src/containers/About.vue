      This project aims to replicate the adventure sheet from the Fighting
      Fantasy series of books in a digital form. Fighting Fantasy is a series of
      role playing books created by Steve Jackson and Ian Livingstone. The
      books, unlike regular novels, use a Choose Your Own Adventure mechanic
      rather than linear story telling. In each book, the reader assumes the
      role of the protagonist and is given choices on each page on how to
      proceed with the adventure by turning to one of a range of pre determined
      pages. There is also an element a dice-based element where combat with
      hostile creatures is resolved with the rolling of dice. There may also be
      other elements of game play the reader may come across from time to time
      which also involve rolling dice.

      To aid the reader during their adventures, each book usually provides an
      "Adventure Sheet" which is designed to help track progress, combat and
      player stats throughout the adventure. It is this adventure sheet that
      this project aims to duplicate.
