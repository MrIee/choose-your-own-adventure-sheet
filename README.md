## About
This project aims to replicate the adventure sheet from the Fighting Fantasy series of books in a digital form.
Fighting Fantasy is a series of role playing books created by Steve Jackson and Ian Livingstone. The books,
unlike regular novels, use a Choose Your Own Adventure mechanic rather than linear story telling. In each book, the reader
assumes the role of the protagonist and is given choices on each page on how to proceed with the adventure by turning to
one of a range of pre determined pages. There is also an element a dice-based element where combat with hostile creatures
is resolved with the rolling of dice. There may also be other elements of game play the reader may come across from time to
time which also involve rolling dice.

To aid the reader during their adventures, each book usually provides an "Adventure Sheet" which is designed to help track
progress, combat and player stats throughout the adventure. It is this adventure sheet that this project aims to duplicate.
